# query_using_properties

- [ ] #task Task in 'query_using_properties'

## Use a one-line property: task_instruction

Read a Tasks instruction from a property in this file, and embed it in to any number of queries in the file:

```tasks
explain
ignore global query
{{query.file.property('task_instruction')}}
limit 10
```

## Use a one-line property: task_instruction_with_spaces

Read a Tasks instruction **that is surrounded by extra spaces** from a property in this file, and embed it in to any number of queries in the file:

```tasks
explain
ignore global query
{{query.file.property('task_instruction_with_spaces')}}
limit 10
```

## Use a multi-line property: task_instructions

Read multiple Tasks instructions from a property in this file, and embed them in to any number of queries in the file:

```tasks
ignore global query
folder includes Test Data
explain
{{query.file.property('task_instructions')}}
limit 10
```

## Use a multi-line property: task_instructions_with_continuation_line

Read multiple Tasks instructions with a continuation line from a property in this file, and embed them in to any number of queries in the file.

Continuation lines are currently unsupported in placeholders.

```tasks
ignore global query
folder includes Test Data
explain
{{query.file.property('task_instructions_with_continuation_line')}}
limit 10
```

## Use a list property in a custom filter: root_dirs_to_search

```tasks
ignore global query
explain

filter by function \
    if (!query.file.hasProperty('root_dirs_to_search')) { \
        throw Error('Please set the "root_dirs_to_search" list property, with each value ending in a backslash...'); \
    } \
    const roots = query.file.property('root_dirs_to_search'); \
    return roots.includes(task.file.root);

limit groups 5
group by root
```
