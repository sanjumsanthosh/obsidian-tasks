## Setting up this manual test

1. Make sure that you have opened the [Tasks-Demo](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/tree/main/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo) test vault previously, so that Obsidian knows where that vault is on your computer.
2. Run the following command

    ```bash
    TZ=Pacific/Auckland open 'obsidian://open?vault=Tasks-Demo&file=Manual%20Testing%2FTime%20Zones%2FPacific-Auckland'
    ```

3. View this page in Reading or Live Preview mode
4. Confirm that the headings in the Tasks block are:
    - `Timezone: Pacific/Auckland`
    - `2024-09-28 Saturday`

## Run the test

1. Complete the task in this file.
2. Check that the due date of the new task - and the new heading - is '2024-09-28 Sunday'
