# Invalid dates with Sorting and Grouping

## Tasks

Numbers indicate the sort order I feel is useful, as invalid dates require action to fix them, so they should be prioritised.

- [ ] #task 1 invalid due date ðŸ“… 1999-02-32
- [ ] #task 2 valid over-due date ðŸ“… 2023-01-01
- [ ] #task 3 valid future-due date ðŸ“… 2050-01-01
- [ ] #task 4 undated

## Query - Grouping

### Group by due - built-in

`Invalid due date` is the first heading, as action is required.

==FIXED==: [Bug report](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2591): **`group by due` and similar should put `Invalid date` heading before the headings for valid dates.**

```tasks
group by due

path includes {{query.file.path}}
hide backlinks
hide postpone button
hide task count
```

### Group by due - custom function

A heading `Invalid date` is the first heading, with the invalid task inside it.

==FIXED==: [Bug report](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2592): **`task.due.category.groupText` and similar should put tasks with invalid dates in a heading `Invalid` or `Invalid date`, not `Future`.**

```tasks
group by function task.due.category.groupText

path includes {{query.file.path}}
hide backlinks
hide postpone button
hide task count
```

## Query - Sorting

### Sort by due - built-in

The invalid task is sorted before the dated ones, since Tasks 6.0.0.

==FIXED==: [Bug report](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2589): **`sort by due` and similar should put tasks with invalid dates before the tasks with valid dates.**

```tasks
sort by due

path includes {{query.file.path}}
hide backlinks
hide postpone button
hide task count
```

### Sort by due - custom function

The invalid task is before the dated ones.

==FIXED==: [Bug report](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2592): **`sort by function task.due.category.groupText` and similar should put tasks with invalid dates before the tasks with valid dates - same for `task.due.category.sortOrder`.**

```tasks
sort by function task.due.category.groupText

path includes {{query.file.path}}
hide backlinks
hide postpone button
hide task count
```

## Expected sort order

```tasks
sort by description

path includes {{query.file.path}}
hide backlinks
hide postpone button
hide task count
```
